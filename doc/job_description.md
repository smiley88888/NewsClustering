Vector Database Specialist for Unsupervised Clustering

Job Overview:
We are seeking a skilled freelancer experienced with vector databases, specifically for the purpose of clustering vectorized data. Our current project involves organizing vectorized article titles stored in a Qdrant vector database into topical clusters using unsupervised learning methods. The ideal candidate will be proficient in clustering techniques like HDBScan, K-means with the elbow method, or similar approaches.

Responsibilities:

Implement and refine unsupervised clustering processes to categorize vectorized URLs into topical clusters.
Work with various datasets ranging from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands of URLs/vectors.
Customize clustering settings for different datasets to ensure optimal clustering quality.
Collaborate with our team to feed clustered titles into GPT models for generating descriptive cluster names.
Continuously evaluate and adjust clustering parameters and methods based on performance and output quality.
Requirements:

Proven experience with vector databases such as Qdrant.
Strong background in machine learning, particularly in unsupervised clustering algorithms like HDBScan or K-means.
Familiarity with the elbow method for determining the optimal number of clusters.
Ability to handle datasets in multiple languages including German and English, with potential future work involving Spanish, French, and other languages.
Capacity to implement adaptive clustering strategies based on dataset-specific requirements (input or output-based adjustments).
Commitment to delivering high-quality, well-structured output.
Desirable Skills:

Experience with Python and relevant data science libraries.
Understanding of parameter selection and optimization for HDBScan, as detailed in the HDBScan documentation:  https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameter_selection.html
Prior work involving text data and natural language processing.
Ability to work flexibly and adapt to changing project needs.
Project Duration: To be discussed.

Compensation: Competitive, based on experience.

Application Process:
Please submit your resume along with a cover letter detailing your relevant experience and a brief explanation of a past project where you successfully implemented clustering of vector data. References or links to previous work will be advantageous. Additionally, familiarize yourself with the clustering document approach similar to this example:  https://dylancastillo.co/clustering-documents-with-openai-langchain-hdbscan/amp/

This project offers an exciting opportunity to work on cutting-edge machine learning applications and contribute to innovative data organization solutions. If you are passionate about clustering techniques and data science, we look forward to hearing from you.
